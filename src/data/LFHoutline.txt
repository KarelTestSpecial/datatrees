                                        Melk en kaas bevatten kleinere hoeveelheden.
                                Energiedrankjes
                                        Synthetische taurine wordt vaak toegevoegd.

                                        Essentieel voor zuigelingen.
                        Gevaren & Bijwerkingen
                                Algemeen als veilig beschouwd
                                        Overtollige taurine wordt door de nieren uitgescheiden.
                                        Geen ernstige bijwerkingen gedocumenteerd bij gezonde volwassenen bij inname tot 3.000 mg per dag.
                                Mogelijke problemen bij zeer hoge doseringen
                                        Kan spijsverteringsproblemen veroorzaken.
                                        Interacties met medicijnen zijn theoretisch mogelijk, maar niet uitgebreid gedocumenteerd.
                                Specifieke groepen
                                        Personen met nieraandoeningen moeten voorzichtig zijn, omdat hun nieren mogelijk geen overschot kunnen verwerken.
                                        Zwangere vrouwen en vrouwen die borstvoeding geven wordt aangeraden voorzichtig te zijn bij gebrek aan onderzoek.
                                Verwarring met energiedrankjes
                                        Negatieve effecten van energiedrankjes zijn meestal te wijten aan de hoge doses cafeïne en suiker, niet aan taurine.
                        Taurine voor Vegans
                                Geen plantaardige bronnen
                                        Taurine komt vrijwel uitsluitend voor in dierlijke weefsels.
                                        Sommige soorten zeewier kunnen sporen bevatten, maar dit is geen betrouwbare bron.
                                Lichaamseigen productie
                                        Het menselijk lichaam kan zelf taurine aanmaken uit de aminozuren cysteïne en methionine, met behulp van vitamine B6.
                                Status bij veganisten
                                        Studies tonen aan dat veganisten significant lagere taurine-niveaus in het bloed hebben dan alleseters.
                                        De meeste veganisten lijken echter geen symptomatisch tekort te ontwikkelen, omdat de lichaamseigen productie doorgaans volstaat.
                                Supplementatie
                                        Voor veganisten die zich zorgen maken, zijn synthetische taurinesupplementen beschikbaar die niet van dierlijke oorsprong zijn.
                                        Dit kan overwogen worden voor specifieke gezondheidsdoelen of bij een dieet dat laag is in de voorlopers (cysteïne en methionine).
